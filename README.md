# Introduction to Massive Data Analysis
NTHU CS 573200; Instructor: Jia-Shung Wang

The course materials are inherited from Stanford CS246: Mining Massive Data Sets.

All of the courseworks are required to complete with **MapReduce**.

HW1: Matrix Multiplication
> Calculate the product of two 500x500 matrices.

HW2: PageRank
> Calculate the page ranks of the nodes in a directed graph.

HW3: Kmeans
> Implement the K-means algorithm in terms of both Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance.

HW4: LSH
> Implement three components: k-shingling, min-hashing, and LSH, to find similar documents.

Term Project: Recommendation System
> Implement item-item collaborative filtering to find similar movies, and make rating predictions.
